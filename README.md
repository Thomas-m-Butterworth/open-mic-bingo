## Essentials
* Persistent storage so users don't lose their game
* Unique board options per user (randomised)
* Board reset ability (new game)
* Selection reset ability
### Things Being Added
The passing a correct night name in the url will return different a bingo game branded for that night of comedy (currently Short For Change, but more to be added). Each night has unique bingo options mixed in to the generic base game.
### Nice to Have
* Scoreboard for speed runners (acts who want to get a full board as fast as possible)
* Websocket options to play with friends (e.g. everyone's game ends when someone gets a bingo)
* Ability for nights to add their own bingo options without asking me
